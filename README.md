# RDR2_Photomode_JPEG
A simple bash script for converting RDR2 photomode images.

Copy your RDR2 image files (usualy at C:\\Users\\[username]\\Documents\\Rockstar Games\\Red Dead Redemption 2\\Profiles\\[profile number]), all files starting with "PRDR".

You will need [libragephoto](https://github.com/Syping/libragephoto), follow the compile instructions at the repository.

Copy the executable `ragephoto-extract` from your build folder `libragephoto-build` to the folder with this script, or change the `$CONVERTOR` variable to your executable path.
